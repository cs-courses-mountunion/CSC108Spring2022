	<h3> What is O'Reilly Learning? </h3>
	<blockquote>
	    The University of Mount Union has a subscription to O'Reilly Learning, a resource that includes over 35,000 technical books that can be accessed
		by Mount Union students for free.&nbsp;  We will make use of this resource for reading assignments throughout the semester.&nbsp; The following 
		instructions will describe how to log into the O'Reilly interface after clicking a link in the "Readings" section of the course web site.
	</blockquote>
	
	<h3> Access the on-line textbook via this link to O'Reilly Learning </h3>
	<ol>
	    <li> Click on <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/" target="_blank">this link to the O'Reilly Learning Home 
		     Page</a> <br/>
		     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (you may need to log in using the directions below) </li><br/>
		<li> From the Home Page, search for the title of our textbook:&nbsp; &nbsp; <code><b>Make: Getting Started in Processing,
             2nd Edition</b></code> </li> <br/>
		<li> Navigate to the correct chapter or section of the book using the Table of Contents icon in the upper-right 
		     corner of the page. </li>
	</ol>

	<h3> How it works: </h3>
	<blockquote>
	    When you click on a link to a Textbook Reference from any of the web pages on the CSC 108 web site, if you are not logged into the O'Reilly system
		already, you will see a screen that looks like this:<br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess01.png" width="540" height="375"/> <br/><br/>
		Click on the pull-down list to select an institution.&nbsp; Mount Union won't be in the list, so you have to choose the first option in the 
		list, entitled "Not listed? Click here.", as shown next: <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess02.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		In the dialog that appears, enter your full Mount Union e-mail address, including the "@mountunion.edu" part at the end.&nbsp; Then click the 
		red "Let's Go" button (note: pressing the [Enter] key doesn't work; you must click with the mouse): <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess03.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		Then you'll see this next screen which indicates that you have entered your e-mail address successfully. <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess04.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		Click the red "Got It" button, and 
		then you see the main O'Reilly Learning Home Page.&nbsp; To access our course textbook, enter the title of our textbook
		in the search field, and press the [Enter] key on the keyboard: <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess05.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		From the search results page, click on our textbook (it has the light blue cover, as seen here): <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess06.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		When the book loads into the browser window, you can navigate from section to section using the 
		"Table of Contents" icon in the top-right corner of the browser window. <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess07.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		Here's what the browser window looks like after clicking the "Table of Contents" icon: <br/><br/>
		<img src="oreillyaccess08.png" width="540" height="375" /> <br/><br/>
		Use the scroll bar in the lower-right corner of the Table of Contents pane to find the chapter/section 
		you wish to read.  <br/><br/>
