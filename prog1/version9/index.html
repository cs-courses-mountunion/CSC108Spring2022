<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Write a Processing program that draws a white circle at the mouse position in a drawing
	window that is sized 700 x 500 pixels, and draws four yellow arcs surrounding
	the circle that follow it wherever it moves in the drawing window.
</blockquote>

<strong>Sample:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Your program should work just like <a href="prog1demo.zip" target="_blank"> this sample</a>.&nbsp; Right-click
	on the link in the preceding sentence and save the file in your CSC108 folder.&nbsp; Then using File Explorer, right-click
	on the .zip file and choose "Extract All" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; After extracting the files from the .zip file,
	there will be a file with a <code>.exe</code> extension &ndash; double-click on the file to run the demo and
	see how your program should work.
</blockquote>

<strong>Starting Point:</strong>
<blockquote>
    To get started on this assignment, make a new Processing sketch, then copy Example 2-2
    from Chapter 2 of the text into the editor.<br/><br/>
	   <b>Example 2-2:</b><br/>
<textarea rows="8" cols="50">
void setup() {
  size(480, 120);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
</textarea>
       <br/><br/>
	
	Change the parameters in the <code>size</code>
	function so that the screen size is correct for this problem.&nbsp; Next, delete all of the lines
	inside the <code>draw</code> function EXCEPT for the last one (the
    "<code>ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);</code>" line).&nbsp; If you run the program now, you should
	see a bunch of circles being drawn over one another.<br/><br/>
	
	Paste the following code as the first lines that are inside the curly braces
	of your <code>draw</code> function:

<pre>
        // clear screen and set background color
        background(204);

        // set filling color for circle at mouse position
        fill(255);
</pre>

    If you run the program now, the trail of circles won't be there; only one circle should
	be drawn, with its center at the mouse position.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task:</strong>
<blockquote>
    You need to add code to the <code>draw</code> function of your program that will draw four
	yellow arcs that are 90&deg; in size.&nbsp; The arcs should be positioned at
	the corners of the circle as seen in the demo. <br/><br/>
	
	In your <code>draw</code> function, set the fill color to a yellow shade
	(use the Processing menu option <b>Tools &rarr; Color Selector</b> as described in 
	the textbook to pick a shade of yellow that you like), and then draw 
	four arcs, using the <code>arc</code> function.&nbsp; The point of the arc should be directed
	toward the white circle -- see the demo program for a visual example of this.&nbsp; The arcs
	in the example 
	have a width and a height of 60 pixels, but you
	can choose different sizes for your arcs, as long as they are located at the four
	corners of the white circle, equally spaced around it.
</blockquote>

<strong>Comment Header at the Top of your Program:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Place a comment header at the top of your program similar to this example, with information
	specific to you and your assignment:
	
<pre>
/********************************
 * CSC 108
 * Programming Assignment # 1
 * Author: Bill Gates
 * Date: January 21, 2022
 ********************************/
</pre>	
</blockquote>

<strong>Extras:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Just for fun, feel free to add some extras to your program.&nbsp; For example, 
	can you change the plain white circle at the mouse position into
	a Pumpkin or an Easter Egg or something else?&nbsp; Have fun experimenting with Processing functions and statements.
</blockquote>

<strong>Due Date:</strong>
<blockquote>
    January 21, 2022, at 11:59pm.&nbsp; <br/><br/>
    You must complete this assignment individually.
</blockquote>

<strong>How to Submit the Program for Grading: </strong>
<blockquote>
    When you have completed your programming assignment, upload the <code>.pde</code> file
	from the directory in which you saved your final version of the programming assignment
	into the <b>Program1</b> dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    Here are some specific directions for submitting work to a D2L Dropbox:	
	<ol>
	    <li> Use a web browser to <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> login to D2L</a>,
	         and go to the CSC 108 course in your course list.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Choose "Assessments", then "Dropbox", and 
	         then click on the link to the "Program1" dropbox folder.&nbsp; This will display the "Program1 Submit Files" page,
	         and you will want to find the "Add a File" button about halfway down the page &mdash; click this button now.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Click on the "Upload" button in the dialog window that appears, browse to the folder where you saved the final version
		     of your program, 
   	         and select the file with the <code>.pde</code> extension.&nbsp; Click the blue "Add" button, then click the blue "Submit" button.&nbsp;
	         If you did this correctly, you should receive a "File submission successful" message in your browser.&nbsp; You will also receive
	         an e-mail message confirming that you submitted the file to the CSC 108 Program1 dropbox.<br/><br/> </li>
	</ol>
