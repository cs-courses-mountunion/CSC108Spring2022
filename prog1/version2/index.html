<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Write a Processing program that draws a white circle at the mouse position in a drawing
	window that is sized 700 x 500 pixels, and draws a red circle that chases the white circle
	around the screen, eventually catching the white circle if the mouse movement is stopped.
</blockquote>

<strong>Sample:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Your program should work just like <a href="prog1demo.zip" target="_blank"> this sample</a>.&nbsp; Right-click
	on the link in the preceding sentence and save the file in your CSC108 folder.&nbsp; Then using File Explorer, right-click
	on the .zip file and choose "Extract All" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; After extracting the files from the .zip file,
	there will be a file with a <code>.exe</code> extension &ndash; double-click on the file to run the demo and
	see how your program should work.
</blockquote>

<strong>Starting Point:</strong>
<blockquote>
    To get started on this assignment, make a new Processing sketch, then copy Example 2-2
    from Chapter 2 of the text into the editor.<br/><br/>
	   <b>Example 2-2:</b><br/>
<textarea rows="8" cols="50">
void setup() {
  size(480, 120);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
</textarea>
       <br/><br/>
	
	Change the parameters in the <code>size</code>
	function so that the screen size is correct for this problem.&nbsp; Next, delete all of the lines
	inside the <code>draw</code> function EXCEPT for the last one (the
    "<code>ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);</code>" line).&nbsp; If you run the program now, you should
	see a bunch of circles being drawn over one another.<br/><br/>
	
	Paste the following code as the first lines that are inside the curly braces
	of your <code>draw</code> function:

<pre>
        // clear screen and set background color
        background(204);

        // set filling color for circle at mouse position
        fill(255);
</pre>

    If you run the program now, the trail of circles won't be there; only one circle should
	be drawn, with its center at the mouse position. <br/><br/>
	
	Next, paste this line at the very top of your program (before the "void setup" line):
	
<pre>
        float x, y;
</pre>

    Then paste these lines inside the curly braces of the <code>setup</code> function:
	
<pre>
        x = 350;
        y = 250;
</pre>

    Finally, at the end of your <code>draw</code> function, set the fill color to a red shade
	(use the Processing menu option <b>Tools &rarr; Color Selector</b> as described on pp. 28 and
    29 of the textbook to pick a shade of red that you like), and then draw an ellipse that is
    centered at (x, y) and is 80 pixels wide and high. <br/><br/>

    If you run the program now, you should have a red circle in the center of the screen, with
    a white circle following your mouse around.&nbsp; Ask your instructor for help if you have
    trouble getting to this point.	
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Right now, your program always draws a red circle at the same position in the window.&nbsp;
	You need to add code to the <code>draw</code> function of your program that will 
	calculate a new position for the red circle's center based on
	the old position of its center and where the mouse is located in the window.&nbsp; To do
	this, you should add a fraction of the distance from the mouse location to the center
	of the red circle to both the <code>x</code> and the <code>y</code> variables (the fraction
	is needed to make the circle "chase" the mouse -- if we added the entire distance, then
	the circles would always be on top of one another).<br/><br/>
	
	We need to make two calculations, one for the horizontal and one for the vertical.&nbsp;
	Consider the horizontal position of the center of the red circle:&nbsp; the distance between
	the centers of the circles can be computed by subtracting the horizontal position of the
	red center from the mouse's horizontal position.&nbsp; This value should be divided by 30, and 
	then that value should be added to the horizontal position of the red circle's center
	to set a new value for the horizontal position of the center of the red circle.&nbsp; 
	You can do this either 
	before or after the red circle is drawn in the <code>draw</code> function; either way will 
	work.&nbsp; Do a similar thing for the vertical position of the center of the red circle
	using the vertical position of the mouse.

<strong>Comment Header at the Top of your Program:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Place a comment header at the top of your program similar to this example, with information
	specific to you and your assignment:
	
<pre>

</pre>	
</blockquote>

<strong>Extras:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Just for fun, feel free to add some extras to your program.&nbsp; For example, 
	can you change the plain white circle at the mouse position into
	a Pumpkin or an Easter Egg or something else?&nbsp; Have fun experimenting with Processing functions and statements.
	<br/><br/>
	If you would like, add this code to the very bottom of your <code>draw</code> function:
	
<pre>
        if (mousePressed) {
            x = y = 700;
        }
</pre>

    This will add the ability to reposition the red circle off the screen whenever the mouse 
	button is clicked.&nbsp; Give it a try!

<strong>Due Date:</strong>
<blockquote>
    January 21, 2022, at the end of class.&nbsp; <br/><br/>
    You must complete this assignment individually.

<strong>How to Submit the Program for Grading: </strong>
<blockquote>
    When you have completed your programming assignment, upload the <code>.pde</code> file
	from the directory in which you saved your final version of the programming assignment
	into the <b>Program1</b> dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    Here are some specific directions for submitting work to a D2L Dropbox:	
	<ol>
	    <li> Use a web browser to <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> login to D2L</a>,
	         and go to the CSC 108 course in your course list.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Choose "Assessments", then "Dropbox", and 
	         then click on the link to the "Program1" dropbox folder.&nbsp; This will display the "Program1 Submit Files" page,
	         and you will want to find the "Add a File" button about halfway down the page &mdash; click this button now.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Click on the "Upload" button in the dialog window that appears, browse to the folder where you saved the final version
		     of your program, 
   	         and select the file with the <code>.pde</code> extension.&nbsp; Click the blue "Add" button, then click the blue "Submit" button.&nbsp;
	         If you did this correctly, you should receive a "File submission successful" message in your browser.&nbsp; You will also receive
	         an e-mail message confirming that you submitted the file to the CSC 108 Program1 dropbox.<br/><br/> </li>
	</ol>
