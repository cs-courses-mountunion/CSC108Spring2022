<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Write a Processing program that allows the user to "pin" a drawing to a screen location 
	by clicking the mouse.&nbsp; There should be a different drawing used depending on whether the
	left or right mouse button is clicked.&nbsp; Pressing the spacebar should clear the screen.&nbsp; You
	will need to use Processing functions to correctly solve this problem.
</blockquote>

<strong>Sample:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Your program should work just like <a href="prog5demo.zip" target="_blank"> 
	this sample</a>.&nbsp; Right-click
	on the link in the preceding sentence and save the file in your CSC108 folder.&nbsp; Then using File Explorer, right-click
	on the .zip file and choose "Extract All" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; After extracting the files from the .zip file,
	there will be a file with a <code>.exe</code> extension &ndash; double-click on the file to run the demo and
	see how your program should work. <br/><br/>
	Run the demo program and click either
	mouse button several times at different locations on the screen; then press the spacebar 
	on the keyboard, then click both mouse buttons again several times at various screen locations.<br/>
	Alternatively, <a href="prog5.mp4">click here</a> to see how the sample program works.
</blockquote>

<strong>Starting Point:</strong>
<blockquote>
    To get started on this assignment, make a new Processing sketch, then paste the 
	following code into the editor window:

    if (key == ' ') {

    }
  } // end if (keyPressed)

  
  if (mousePressed) {
  
    if (mouseButton == LEFT) {
	
    }

    if (mouseButton == RIGHT) {
	
    }

  } // end if (mousePressed)

  
} // end of draw function


void drawLeft(int x, int y) {

} // end of drawLeft function


void drawRight(int x, int y) {

} // end of drawRight function
</pre>

    When you run this program, nothing much will happen &mdash; this is just the starting
	structure for your program.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 1:&nbsp; Instantiate one <code>int</code> variable, two <code>int</code> Arrays, and one 
<code>char</code> Array.</strong>
<blockquote>
    In the <code>setup</code> function, set the variable named <code>numClicks</code> to zero.&nbsp; Then 
	set up the three arrays named <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>direction</code> so that they can
	store 500 values each.&nbsp; Refer to Example 11-9 in the
    <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	textbook</a>
	for an example of how to do this.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 2:&nbsp; Write the initial versions of the other functions for the program so
        that creatures are drawn when the mouse is clicked.</strong>
<blockquote>
    Here is an outline of the logic you should use for the <code>draw</code> function of your program,
	in order to get it to work as the sample does: <br/>
	<ol>
	  <li> if (the spacebar has been pressed):
	      <ol type="a">
	          <li> Set the background to 204 </li>
		      <li> store the value zero in <code>numClicks</code> </li>
		  </ol> </li>
	  <li> if (the mouse has been clicked):
          <ol type="a">
		      <li> add 1 to <code>numClicks</code> </li>
			  <li> store <code>mouseX</code> in <code>x[numClicks]</code> </li>
			  <li> store <code>mouseY</code> in <code>y[numClicks]</code> </li>
			  <li> if (the left mouse button was clicked):
			      <ul type="circle">
				      <li> store <code>'L'</code> in <code>direction[numClicks]</code> (don't forget the single quotes)</li>
				  </ul> </li>
			  <li> if (the right mouse button was clicked):
			      <ul type="circle">
				      <li> store <code>'R'</code> in <code>direction[numClicks]</code> </li>
				  </ul> </li>
          </ol> </li>	
	  <li> for each value of <code>i</code> from 1 up to and including <code>numClicks</code>:
	       <ol type="a">
		       <li> if <code>direction[i]</code> is <code>'L'</code>:
			      <ul type="circle">
				      <li> call the <code>drawLeft</code> function using
	                          (<code>x[i]</code>, <code>y[i]</code>) as arguments</li>
				  </ul> </li>
		       <li> if <code>direction[i]</code> is <code>'R'</code>:
			      <ul type="circle">
				      <li> call the <code>drawRight</code> function using
	                          (<code>x[i]</code>, <code>y[i]</code>) as arguments</li>
				  </ul> </li>
		   </ol> </li>
	</ol> 
	
	Go to Example 3-21 in the "Custom Shapes" section of Chapter 3 of the 
    <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	textbook</a>,
	copy the 14 lines after the "// left creature" comment and paste them in as the body of the <code>
	drawLeft</code> function.&nbsp; Then find the <code>endShape();</code> statement in the code you just
	copied and add <code>CLOSE</code> inside the parentheses.&nbsp; Next, copy the lines from example 3-21
	after the "// right creature" comment and paste them
	in as the body of the <code>drawRight</code> function, and add <code>CLOSE</code> inside the parentheses
	of the <code>endShape();</code> statement in this code block also.<br/><br/>
	   <b>Exercise 3-21:</b><br/>
<textarea rows="8" cols="50">

// Left creature
fill(153, 176, 180);

	When you run this version of your program after following the directions above, clicking the left mouse button anywhere on the screen 
	should make the
	left creature appear, clicking the right mouse button makes the right creature appear, and pressing
	the space bar erases the screen.&nbsp; The next step is to add the ability for the functions to
	draw the creatures in specific positions in the window.
	
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 3:&nbsp; Change the <code>drawLeft</code> and <code>drawRight</code> functions 
        to draw the shapes relative to the (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) parameters instead of at
		fixed positions on the screen.</strong>
<blockquote>
    We want the creatures to be drawn so that the tip of their noses is drawn at the mouse position when
	the user clicks a mouse button.&nbsp; This means that the vertex that represents the tip of the creature's
	nose will use (x, y) as its arguments instead of actual numbers, and the other vertex statements in the functions
	will use (x plus or minus a number, y plus or minus a number) to define their points.&nbsp; Then when we
    call the functions with different arguments, the creatures will appear in different screen locations.
    <br/><br/>
	
    In the <code>drawLeft</code> function, the vertex that represents the tip of the creature's nose is
	(210, 60).&nbsp; So we need to change each of the vertex statements in this function to be relative
	to that point.&nbsp; The first vertex statement in the function is <code>vertex(50,&nbsp;120);</code>.&nbsp;
	To make this relative to the point (210, 60), we need to change the first statement to be
	<code>vertex(210-160,&nbsp;60+60);</code>, because 50&nbsp;==&nbsp;210&nbsp;-&nbsp;160, and 
	120&nbsp;==&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;60.&nbsp; The second vertex statement in the function is 
	<code>vertex(100,&nbsp;90);</code>,
	so it needs to be changed to <code>vertex(210-110,&nbsp;60+30);</code><br/><br/>
	
	Change the rest of the <code>vertex</code> statements in the <code>drawLeft</code> function so that they
	are defined relative to the point (210, 60).&nbsp; You will also need to change the <code>ellipse</code>
	statement so that the first argument is 210 minus something that is equal to 155.&nbsp; If you run this
	version of the program and click the left mouse button, it should work exactly as before.<br/><br/>
	
	Now, change all of the "<code>210</code>"s in the <code>vertex</code> statements and the 
	<code>ellipse</code> statement, replacing them with <code>x</code>.&nbsp; Similarly, change all of the 
	"<code>60</code>"s to <code>y</code>.&nbsp; Now when you run the program, the bluish creatures will be
	drawn in various screen locations, depending on where the mouse was clicked.<br/><br/>
	
	Change the <code>drawRight</code> function in a similar way, so that the greenish creatures are drawn at
	the mouse position when the right mouse button is clicked.&nbsp; The tip of the right creature's nose
	is located at the point (280, 50) in the original code.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 4:&nbsp; Add some extra feature to the <code>drawLeft</code> and <code>drawRight</code>
functions.</strong>
<blockquote>
    If you look at the results of your program now, and compare them to the demo program given above, you'll
	notice that an extra feature was added to the demo program in addition to the code from Example 3-21 
	(specifically, the creatures are drawn with eyebrows in the demo program, and your creatures don't have 
	eyebrows).&nbsp; Add statements to the
	<code>drawLeft</code> and <code>drawRignt</code> functions in your program
	to draw some extra feature(s) on your
	creatures.&nbsp; The choice of what to draw is up to you -- can you give the creatures triangular white
	teeth?&nbsp; How about a hat?&nbsp; What about different colors for different parts of the head, neck, etc.?
	&nbsp;Can you give your creatures arms, legs, etc.?&nbsp; Use your creativity to add at least one
	extra visual feature to each one of your creatures.
</blockquote>

<strong>Comment Header at the Top of your Program:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Be sure to change the comment header for your program so that it uses your name and
	has today's date.
</blockquote>

<strong>How to Submit the Program for Grading: </strong>
<blockquote>
    When you have completed your programming assignment, upload the <code>.pde</code> file
	from the directory in which you saved your final version of the programming assignment
	into the <b>Program5</b> dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
