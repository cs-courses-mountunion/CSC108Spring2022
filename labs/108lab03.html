Topics:&nbsp; Repetition with <code>for</code> loops <br/><br/>
In these lab exercises, instructions with a yellow background indicate a task that should be
demonstrated to your instructor when completed, in order to earn points for the lab.
<br/><br/>

<hr/><br/>

<ol>
  <li> Create a new Processing program (called a sketch) and save it right away in your
       <em><b>CSC108</b></em> folder using the name <em><b>LAB03</b></em> (being sure not to
	   use any spaces in the file name).
       <br/><br/> </li>

In the section entitled "Repetition" in Chapter 4 of the 
       <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	   textbook</a>, read the text and try
       the code from Example 4-6&mdash; actually copy the code from the book and
	   paste it into the Processing editor window to run the code.&nbsp;DON'T JUST RUN THE CODE &mdash;
	   try to understand how it works.<br/><br/>
	   <b>Exercise 4-6:</b><br/>

size(480, 120);
strokeWeight(8);
for (int i = 20; i &lt; 400; i += 60) {
  line(i, 40, i + 60, 80);
}
</textarea>
<br/><br/>

	   You don't need to save your work between Exercises unless you want to -- in that case,
	   use the "New" button from the Processing Toolbar, and use names such as
	   <em><b>LAB03a</b></em>, <em><b>LAB03b</b></em>, etc. <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Change the <code>line</code> function call in your program so that it looks like this:
<pre>
    line( i+60, 40, i, 80);
</pre>
       When you run this program, the results differ from the original version.&nbsp; WHY?!?
	   <br/><br/> </li> 

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Change the program you are working on so that the lines drawn are straight up and down.
	   &nbsp; When you have achieved this, show your results to your instructor. (1 pt)
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Go back to the textbook and read the material after Example 4-6.&nbsp; Then 
       complete Examples 4-7 and 4-8.&nbsp; Run the program and move the mouse
       around the window to see what happens with the arrow and the line.&nbsp; Be sure you understand why the
	   results of the two programs are different.

	   <b>Exercise 4-8:</b><br/>
<textarea rows="4" cols="50">
size(480, 120);
strokeWeight(2);
for (int i = 20; i &lt; 400; i += 20) {
  line(i, 0, i + i/2, 80);

  <li> Copy this code into the Processing editor window:
<pre>
for (int i = 6; i &lt;= 9; i++) {
    print("This time i = ");
    println(i);
    print("\t i squared = ");
    println(i*i);
}
println("program concluded.");
</pre>  
	  What this <code>for</code> loop does in its header is: 
	  <ul>    <li>Sets up an initial value for i (6)</li>
		  <li>Tests to make sure i is still less than or equal to 9</li>
		  <li>Increments i by 1 (meaning, updates the value of i to i+1) each time the loop runs</li></ul>
	  The code that executes inside the <code>for</code> loop:
	  <ul>    <li>prints "This time i = " to the console</li>
		  <li>prints the value of i, and then goes to the next line</li>
		  <li>prints a tab, followed by "i squared = "</li>
		  <li>prints the value of i*i, which of course, is i squared</li></ul>
		  
	  Run the program and observe the output printed in the Console.&nbsp; Then change the
	   program so that it prints the squares of the multiples of 3 between 27 and 42, inclusive.&nbsp;
	   Hint:&nbsp; you should only make changes to the heading of the <code>for</code> loop, not
	   to the loop body.
       <br><br> </li>
	   
<li> <span class="yellow">
       Add code to the loop in your current program so that it prints the cube of each of the
	   <b><code>i</code></b> values, on a separate line immediately following the square of each of the values.&nbsp;
	   Then change the loop heading so that your program prints the squares and cubes of the multiples
	   of 4 between 8 and 28, inclusive (so the numbers your for loop will be looking at are between 4-28).&nbsp; Show your program
	   to your instructor when you get it working properly. (2 pts)
	 </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Copy this code into the Processing editor window:
<pre>
int howManyCircles = 4;

void setup() {
    size(500, 500);
    fill(255, 255, 0);
    stroke(0, 0, 102);
	frameRate(8);
} // end setup

void draw() {
    background(0, 0, 102);
    int x = 40;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= howManyCircles; i++) {
        ellipse(x, 40, 45, 45);
        x = x + 50;
    } // end for
} // end draw
</pre>  
What this program is doing:
<ul>
	<li>declares a global integer variable, howManyCircles, and initializes its value to 4</li>
	<li>in the setup() function, sets the window size, fill color, stroke color, and drastically reduces the frameRate (this will matter later!)</li>
	<li>in the draw() function, resets the background color, declares an integer variable x and initializes it to 40</li>
	<li>sets up the header of a <code>for</code> loop:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
  <li style="margin-left:2em">sets an initial value of i (1)</li>
  <li style="margin-left:2em">tests to make sure i is still less than or equal to howManyCircles</li>
 <li style="margin-left:2em">increments i by 1 each time the loop runs</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>has the following code run each time the <code>for</code> loop runs:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
		<li style="margin-left:2em">draws a circle centered at (x, 40) with radius = 45</li>
  <li style="margin-left:2em">updates the value of x to x+50</li>
			     </ol></li></ul> 
	
	  Run the program and observe the results.&nbsp; Then change the
	   program so that it draws 8 circles.
       <br><br> </li>
	   
<li>
       Modify the program so that it draws green circles that are displayed going down 
	   the left side of the window, not across the top.&nbsp; Change the program
	   so that five green circles are drawn going down the screen.
	   <br><br> </li>
	   
<li> <span class="yellow">
       Modify the program so that it draws green circles that are displayed going down and
       to the right diagonally from the upper-left corner of the window.&nbsp; Change the program
	   so that seven green circles are drawn going down the screen.&nbsp; Show your program
	   to your instructor when you get it working properly. (2 pts)
	 </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

   <li> Copy this code and paste it into the editor window, replacing the last two lines
        in your program:
<pre>
    } // end for
    if (mousePressed) {
        howManyCircles = 3;
    } // end if
} // end draw
</pre>  
       Run the program and then click the mouse button 5 times, observing what happens.&nbsp; 
       <br><br> </li>

<li> <span class="yellow">
       Modify the program so that it initially draws 1 green circle, and every time the
       user clicks the mouse button, <code>howManyCircles</code> is increased by one, so
	   that clicking the mouse repeatedly causes more and more circles to appear on
	   screen.&nbsp; Show your program
	   to your instructor when you get it working properly. (2 pts) [Once you get it working right, try commenting out the "frameRate(8);" line near the top...why does this happen?!]

	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> For a short diversion, let's browse a nice website that provides matched palettes 
       of color that artists have contributed.&nbsp; The site is 
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017134122/http://www.colorschemer.com:80/" target="_blank">
	   http://www.colorschemer.com</a>
	   &mdash; visit it now.&nbsp; (This site is available through the Web Archive "WayBackMachine" -- it's pretty cool and fun!) &nbsp; Click on the "Scheme Gallery" top menu item, and scroll
	   down the first page of color schemes that are displayed.&nbsp; At the bottom of
	   the page, you see a navigation line that allows you to go to the next page of
	   schemes or to select a specific page number.&nbsp; Browse through a couple of pages
	   to page 3 and look at the "Brick &amp; Ivy" scheme in the middle of that page.
	   <br/><br/>
	   Let's say you wanted to use the greenish color in the
	   Brick &amp; Ivy scheme (the second square from the left)
	   as the background color for your Processing program; to see what the color number
	   would be for this color, move your mouse so that it is hovering over that square in
	   the scheme.&nbsp; What you should notice is that a little pop-up hint appears with 
	   the hexadecimal information "#60715F." &nbsp; You can use this code just like you'd use a hex code from Processing's Color Selector.
	  <!-- &mdash; what the heck is that?&nbsp; If you are
	   familiar with setting colors in web pages, you may recognize this format of 
	   color information.&nbsp; It turns out that the first two characters after the #
       represent the red part of the color, the middle two characters are the green value,
       and the last two characters are the blue part of the color.&nbsp; But the problem
       is that the values are specified in hexadecimal notation, not normal decimal numbers.
       Luckily, Processing can work with hexadecimal values if we use special notation
       when using those values.&nbsp; If a numeric value in Processing starts with "0x", then
	   that value is interpreted as being in hexadecimal notation. -->
       <br/><br/>
       Here's an example of how we can use these values &mdash; in the program you currently
	   are running in your Processing editor window, locate the <code>background</code> function
	   call at the top of the <code>draw</code> function, and change it to use the #60715F color
	   like this:
<pre>
    background(#60715F);
</pre>	   
       Pretty nice, huh?&nbsp; Now change the <code>stroke</code> and <code>fill</code>
	   function calls in the <code>setup</code> function so that they both use the
	   medium tan color in the Brick &amp; Ivy scheme (fourth one from the left).       
	   <br/><br/> </li>
	   
  <li> Copy this code into the Processing editor window:
<pre>
size(400, 400);
background(#C8C69F);
stroke(#82683C);
fill(#A6AC92);
strokeWeight(3);

int x, y;

// draw first row of 6 columns starting at (40, 80);
rect( 40,  80, 25, 25);
rect( 80,  80, 25, 25);
rect(120,  80, 25, 25);
rect(160,  80, 25, 25);
rect(200,  80, 25, 25);
rect(240,  80, 25, 25);

// draw second row of 6 columns starting at (40, 120);
rect( 40, 120, 25, 25);
rect( 80, 120, 25, 25);
rect(120, 120, 25, 25);
rect(160, 120, 25, 25);
rect(200, 120, 25, 25);
rect(240, 120, 25, 25);

// draw third row of 6 columns starting at (40, 160);
rect( 40, 160, 25, 25);
rect( 80, 160, 25, 25);
rect(120, 160, 25, 25);
rect(160, 160, 25, 25);
rect(200, 160, 25, 25);
rect(240, 160, 25, 25);

// draw fourth row of 6 columns starting at (40, 200);
rect( 40, 200, 25, 25);
rect( 80, 200, 25, 25);
rect(120, 200, 25, 25);
rect(160, 200, 25, 25);
rect(200, 200, 25, 25);
rect(240, 200, 25, 25);
</pre>  
       Run the program and observe the results.&nbsp; Boy, that code looks very repetitive,
	   doesn't it?&nbsp; Take a close look at the code that draws the first row &mdash; what
	   is the only thing that is changing?&nbsp; Note that the only thing that changes is the
	   first number in parentheses, which is the horizontal position of the rectangle to 
	   be drawn.&nbsp; If we would replace those changing numbers with a variable, we
	   could try to draw 6 rectangles with this code:
<pre>
x = 40;
for (int col = 1; col &lt;= 6; col++) {
    rect( x, 80, 25, 25);
} // end for	   
</pre>
       Copy this and paste it in your program to replace
	   the first block of 6 <code>rect</code> statements.&nbsp; What happens
       when you run it?&nbsp; Hey, how come there aren't 6 rectangles in the first row?&nbsp; The
       problem is that we drew 6 rectangles, but they are all on top of one another.&nbsp; 
       What we need to do is after drawing one rectangle and before the end of the loop, we
	   need to add 40 to <code>x</code> so that the next time around in the loop, 
	   the value of <code>x</code> is what
	   we want for the next rectangle.&nbsp; Add such a statement now and run your program.&nbsp; 
	   That's much better, isn't it?
       <br><br> </li>
	   
<li> <span class="yellow">
       Change the <code>for</code> loop so that it draws 8 squares, not 6.&nbsp; Then modify
	   all of the other code blocks that draw the other rows so that they 
	   use <code>for</code> loops.&nbsp; When you have finished this, copy and paste so that
	   your program draws 5 rows of 8 columns of squares &mdash; you should only have 5 
	   <code>rect</code> statements in your entire program to accomplish this.&nbsp; 
	   Show your program
	   to your instructor when you get it working properly. (2 pts)
	 </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

   <li> OK, so far, so good.&nbsp; But now notice that the code for each row is exactly the same,
        except for one thing -- the vertical position of the rectangles being drawn.&nbsp; 
        To prevent this duplication, we can change the block of code that draws the first 
        row so that the vertical position is a variable, and then surround that with a loop 
		that is repeated once for each row we want to draw.&nbsp; Something like this:
		<blockquote> <code>
		    y = <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#990099">the starting y value we want to use for row 1</font> ; <br/>
			for (int row = 1; row &lt;= <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#990099">the last row we want to draw</font>; row++) { <br/><br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#990099">// all of the code to draw one row should appear here <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // with the change that the rect statement should be <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // changed to </font>rect( x, y, 25, 25 ); <br/><br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y = y + <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#990099">the change in vertical position from one row to the next</font> ;<br/>
		    } // end outer for
		</code> </blockquote>
		Make these changes, and then delete all of the code for the second through the fifth
		rows that you had before.&nbsp; There should only be ONE <code>rect</code> statement
		in the program now.
		<br/><br/> </li>
	   
<li> <span class="yellow">
       Change the program so that it draws 7 rows of 4 columns each.&nbsp; There must only 
	   be one <code>rect</code> statement in your program.&nbsp;
