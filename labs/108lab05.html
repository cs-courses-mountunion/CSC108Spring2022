Topics:&nbsp; Arrays, and a 3D Demo <br/><br/>
In these lab exercises, instructions with a yellow background indicate a task that should be
demonstrated to your instructor when completed, in order to earn points for the lab.
<br/><br/>

<hr/><br/>

<ol>
  <li> Create a new Processing program (called a sketch) and save it right away in your
       <em><b>CSC108</b></em> folder using the name <em><b>LAB05</b></em> (being sure not to
	   use any spaces in the file name).
       <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Start reading Chapter 11, entitled "Arrays", in the 
       <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	   textbook</a>; read the text and try
       the code from Examples 11-1, 11-2 and 11-3 &mdash; actually copy the code from the book and
	   paste it into the Processing editor window to run the code.&nbsp;DON'T JUST RUN THE CODE &mdash;
	   try to understand how it works.**Note: Please use the code below for Example 11-3! The book contains a small error.**<br/><br/>

	   You don't need to save your work between Exercises unless you want to -- in that case,
	   use the "New" button from the Processing Toolbar, and use names such as
	   <em><b>LAB05a</b></em>, <em><b>LAB05b</b></em>, etc. <br/><br/> </li>

  <li>Modify the program from Example 11-3 as follows:<br>
	  <ul><li>Modify the program so that the array <code>x</code> contains 1000
	  elements.</li>
	  <li>Then as the second statement in the file, declare a second array named
		  <code>y</code> as an array of <code>float</code> values that also has 1000 elements.</li>
	   <li>Next, inside the <code>for</code> loop in the <code>setup</code> function, set the 
		   value in <code>y[i]</code> to a random value between 0 and 120.</li>
	  <li>Then in the
	   <code>draw</code> function, delete the line that starts "<code>float y =</code>", and
	   then change the second parameter in the <code>arc</code> 
		  function call so that it is <code>y[i]</code></li>
	  <li>Run the program and verify that
		  a large number of PacMen are moving horizontally across the output window.</li></ul>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Now make changes that will cause the value of <code>x[i]</code> and <code>y[i]</code>
	   to change randomly in the <code>draw</code> function.&nbsp; 
	  <ul><li>Replace the <code>0.5</code>
	   in the statement that changes <code>x[i]</code> with a call to the <code>random</code>
		  function that generates a value between &ndash;1.1 and 2.5.&nbsp;</li>
		  <li>Then add a new statement to
	   the program located immediately before the <code>arc</code> statement that adds
			  a randomly-generated value to <code>y[i]</code> that is between -2 and 2.&nbsp;</li> 
	   <li>Run your program and notice the random movement of the PacMen.&nbsp; 
		   Show your results to your instructor. (4 pts)</li></ul>
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Move ahead in the textbook to the section entitled "Repetition and
       Arrays".&nbsp; Copy the following code that appears at the top of this section of the text into the Processing editor window
	   and run it to verify that the output is as predicted in the comments in the code.
<pre>
int[] x = new int[2];     // Declare and create the array
println(x.length);        // Prints 2 to the Console

int[] y = new int[1972];  // Declare and create the array
println(y.length);        // Prints 1972 to the Console
</pre>	   

	   Run Example 11-8 from the textbook.&nbsp; Then change the size of the
	   output window so that it is 240 &times; 600 and run the program again.&nbsp; Then make
	   the output window 720 &times; 600.
       <br/><br/>
	   <b>Exercise 11-8:</b><br/>
<textarea rows="6" cols="50">
float[] gray;

void setup() {
  size(240, 120);
  gray = new float[width];
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; gray.length; i++) {
    gray[i] = random(0, 255);
  }
}

void draw() {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; gray.length; i++) {
    stroke(gray[i]);
    line(i, 0, i, height);
  }
}
</textarea>
       <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Make the following changes:&nbsp; 
	  <ul><li>Rename the array called <code>gray</code> so that it
       is named <code>red</code> (you'll need to make six changes to the program to accomplish
		  this).</li> \
		  <li>Next, add two more arrays of <code>float</code> values to the program, one
			  called <code>green</code> and another called <code>blue</code>.&nbsp; Declare both
			  of these arrays at the top of the program.</li>
		  <li>Instantiate both of these new arrays so that they have the
	   same number of slots as <code>red</code> does using the <code>new</code>
	   keyword inside <code>setup</code>, and then store a 
	   random value between 0 and 255 in them
			  inside the <code>for</code> loop.</li>
		  <li>Then change the <code>stroke</code> function call in 
	   your <code>draw</code> function so that it uses three values to set the stroke color.
	   &nbsp; When you run the program, you should see a bunch of multi-colored lines, not just
			  shades of gray.</li></ul>
       <br><br> </li>

  <li> Add yet another array of <code>float</code> values to the program
	   called <code>x</code>.&nbsp; This array should have the same number of slots as
	   the other three arrays, and in the loop in the <code>setup</code> function, 
	   you should store the value <code>i</code> in <code>x[i]</code>.&nbsp; In the <code>
	   line</code> function call in your <code>draw</code> function, change the two occurrences
	   of <code>i</code> to <code>x[i]</code>.&nbsp; When you run this program, you should notice
	   no difference in the output -- it should still be a bunch of multi-colored vertical 
	   lines on the screen.
       <br><br> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Now change the program so that three new specific things are added to the existing
	   program as the first
	   three actions inside the 
	   <code>for</code> loop of your <code>draw</code> function.&nbsp; First of all, set
	   the stroke color to black.&nbsp; Secondly, draw a line from (<code>x[i]</code>, 0) to 
	   (<code>x[i]</code>, 100).&nbsp; Thirdly, add a randomly-generated value between 0.1 and
	   4.5 to <code>x[i]</code>.&nbsp; Running the program now should show colored lines moving 
	   haphazardly off the window to the right.
	   <br/><br/>
	   Then declare a single <code>int</code> variable (not an array) at the top of the 
	   file named <code>direction</code> and give it a starting value of 1.&nbsp; Change the value
	   being added to <code>x[i]</code> in the <code>draw</code> function so that it is 
	   <code>direction</code> times a 
	   random value between 0.1 and 4.5.&nbsp; Then copy the following code and paste it into
	   <code>draw</code> immediately before the final <code>}</code> symbol in your file:
<pre>
if (x[0] > width || x[width-1] &lt; 0) {
  direction = -direction;
}
</pre>	   
	   Show your results 
	   to your instructor.
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Copy Example 11-9 from the textbook into a Processing sketch.&nbsp; 
       Then change the size of the output window so that it is 720 &times; 600.&nbsp; Run
	   the program &mdash; pretty nice, isn't it?!?
       <br/><br/>
	   <b>Exercise 11-9:</b><br/>

</textarea>
       <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Add an <code>if</code> statement to the bottom of the <code>draw</code> function
	   (be careful to add this inside the final <b><code>}</code></b> symbol) that tests to see
	   if the mouse has been pressed, and if so, sets <code>x[0]</code> and
	   <code>y[0]</code> to -100.&nbsp; Run the program and move the mouse around, then
	   hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse around.&nbsp; The circles should disappear
	   when you drag the mouse, and reappear when you just move the mouse without holding
	   down a button.&nbsp; Show your program to your instructor when it works like this.
