            Lab Exercise # 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Due:&nbsp; February 14, 2022 (anything not shown to your instructor by the end of class should be submitted by 11:59 pm on D2L) </h2></center></font>

Topics:&nbsp; Images, Motion, Randomness <br/><br/>
In these lab exercises, instructions with a yellow background indicate a task that should be
demonstrated to your instructor when completed, in order to earn points for the lab.
<br/><br/>
	
	<b>You may work in groups of 2 or 3 on this lab. <em>Each student must complete all highlighted items to earn credit.</em></b>
	<br><br/>

<hr/><br/>

<ol>
  <li> Several exercises in this lab will use media files that have been downloaded for you
	   and that have been converted into a .zip file.&nbsp; You will need to unzip the files
	   to be able to use them in this lab. <br/><br/>
	   <ol type="a">
       <li>
	   Right-click on this link to the <a href="lab04files.zip" target="_blank"> lab04files.zip</a> file
	   and choose "Save File as..." from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Browse to your CSC108 folder and save the 
	   zip file.
       <br/><br/>
	   </li>
	   <li>Launch File Explorer (the icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like this: 
	   <img src="108lab04FileExplorer.png"/> ).&nbsp; Browse to your CSC108 folder, then right-click 
	   on the .zip file you just saved, and choose "Extract all" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Make sure 
	   that the files will be extracted into a folder in your CSC108 folder, and check the box that 
	   says "Show extracted files when complete".&nbsp; Then click the "Extract" button.&nbsp; A new 
	   File Explorer window will appear, showing the files that you will need at various points in this
	   lab activity.&nbsp; Leave the File Explorer window open on your
	   desktop. &ndash; we'll use this folder whenever prompted by the textbook
	   or the lab instructions to find or use a file.&nbsp; Ask your instructor for help if you need it
	   to extract the files from the .zip file.<br/><br/>
	   </li>
	   </ol>

  <li> Create a new Processing program (called a sketch) and save it right away in your
       <em><b>CSC108</b></em> folder using the name <em><b>LAB04</b></em> (being sure not to
	   use any spaces in the file name).
       <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Processing is capable of drawing more than simple lines and shapes.&nbsp; We will now learn how 
       to load image files and fonts into our programs to extend the visual possibilities to 
	   photography, detailed diagrams, and different typefaces.<br/><br/>
	   
	   Using the sketch you just created, select <b>Add File</b> from the Sketch menu.&nbsp; Find the
	   <code>lunar.jpg</code> file in the folder you just unzipped and select it.&nbsp; 
	  <!--If everything went well, the Message Area will read "One file added to the sketch."-->
	  <br/><br/>

       To check for the file, select <b>Show Sketch Folder</b> in the Sketch menu.&nbsp; You should see 
	   a folder named <b>data</b>, with a copy of <code>lunar.jpg</code> inside.&nbsp; When you add a file 
	   to the sketch, the <b>data</b> folder will automatically be created.&nbsp; Instead of using the 
	   <b>Add File</b> menu command, you can do the same thing by dragging files into the editor 
	   area of the Processing window.&nbsp; The files will be copied to the data folder the same way 
	   (and the data folder will be created if none exists).<br/><br/>

      <!-- You can also create the data folder outside of Processing and copy files there yourself.&nbsp; This is a helpful method when you're 
	   working with large numbers of files.<br/><br/> -->
	   
  <li> Start with the "Images" section in Chapter 7 of the 
       <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	   textbook</a> and work through Examples 7-1 and 7-2
	   &mdash; actually copy the code from the book and
	   paste it into the Processing editor window to run the code.&nbsp;DON'T JUST RUN THE CODE &mdash;
	   try to understand how it works.
	   <br/><br/>
	   If you get an error message that says "Null Pointer Exeption", you most likely did not
	   perform the "Add Files" operation correctly to add the image file to your processing 
	   sketch.&nbsp; You must
	   add the media file that is used in the example program you are trying to run to the sketch
	   before running the examples in this section.&nbsp; If you use the "Add Files" option of the
	   "Sketch" menu, that'll fix the Null Pointer Exeption error.
	          <br/><br/>

	   You don't need to save your work between Exercises unless you want to -- in that case,
	   use the "New" button from the Processing Toolbar, and use names such as
	   <em><b>LAB04a</b></em>, <em><b>LAB04b</b></em>, etc. <br/><br/> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Create a brand new Processing sketch and name it "Initials".&nbsp; Copy the code from
	   Example 7-2 in the textbook and paste it into the editor window.&nbsp; You will
	   change this code so that three images will be displayed side by side in the output window.
	   <br/><br/>
       In the "lab04files" folder you unzipped earlier, there is a
	   folder named "Letters".&nbsp; Use the "Add Files" option of the "Sketch" menu to add three
	   of the image files in this folder to your sketch that correspond to your initials (if you 
	   have repeated initials, BBC for example, then you only need to add two files to your
	   sketch).&nbsp; Then change the code example so that the images representing your initials
	   are displayed in the output window.&nbsp; Each of the files is 160 pixels &times;
	   120 pixels, so they will fit exactly in the window, because it is sized 480 &times; 120.
	   &nbsp; When you have achieved this, show your results to your instructor. (2 pts)
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Save the "Initials" sketch, and start a brand-new empty Processing sketch to continue
       with this lab.&nbsp; Go back to Chapter 7 of the textbook and then copy and run Examples 7-3, 
	   7-4 and 7-5.

<br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Open the sketch file "Initials" from where you saved it earlier, and make modifications
       to the file as described here.&nbsp; First of all, in the <code>setup</code> function,
	   increase the vertical size of the
	   output window to 480.&nbsp; Next, set the background of the screen to 
	   black as the first statement in the <code>draw</code> function.
       <br><br> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Now change each of the <code>image</code> statements in your <code>draw</code> function so
	   that it uses the five-parameter style shown in Example 7-3.&nbsp; The fourth 
       parameter is the width of the image being displayed, and the fifth parameter is the height
	   of the image.&nbsp; In each of the <code>image</code> statements in your program,
	   the fourth parameter should be a fixed number that represents one-third of the width
	   of the display window.&nbsp; The fifth parameter should use 
	   <code>mouseY</code> so that the images grow or shrink vertically as the mouse is moved around 
	   the window.&nbsp;Show your results to your instructor. (3 pts)
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Save the "Initials" sketch, and start a brand-new empty Processing sketch to continue
       with this lab.&nbsp; Go to the "Frames" section of Chapter 8 in the textbook, read the 
	   text and try Examples
	   8-1 and 8-2.<br/><br/>

</textarea>
<br/><br/> </li>

  <li> Starting with the code for Example 8-5, make the following changes:&nbsp; the first three
       lines of the program from the textbook should be changed to look like this:
<pre>
int radius = 120;
float y = 300;
float speed = 1.5;
</pre>	   
       Then change the <code>size</code> function call in the <code>setup</code> function
	   so that the output window is 160 pixels wide and 720 tall.&nbsp; Don't run the program 
	   yet -- it won't work because our changes are incomplete.
       <br><br> </li>

  <li> Now change the program so that the PacMan image moves up and down on the screen
       instead of left and right.&nbsp; There are several changes that need to be made in
	   the <code>draw</code> function in order for this to happen &mdash; any line that 
	   refers to <code>x</code> should be changed to use the variable <code>y</code>
	   instead, in this fashion: the <code>draw</code> function should add <code>speed*direction</code>
	   to <code>y</code>, then test <code>y</code> to see if it is either greater than
	   <code>height&ndash;radius</code> or less than zero.&nbsp; The other changes that should be 
	   made are that the two <code>arc</code> function calls need to have a fixed value for
	   the first parameter, and use <code>y</code> as the second parameter.&nbsp; When you make
	   these changes and run the program, the PacMan should move up and down in the output 
	   window.
       <br><br> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Now change the program so that instead of drawing a PacMan, it uses an image of an 
	   upward-pointing arrow when the movement is toward the top of the window and an image
	   of a downward-pointing arrow when moving toward the bottom of the screen.&nbsp;
	   There are two image files in the "lab04files" folder named <b>arrowUp.png</b> and
	   <b>arrowDown.png</b> &mdash; use the "Add Files" option of the "Sketch" menu to add
	   these files to your Processing sketch now.&nbsp; Then refer back to the Examples we tried
	   in Chapter 7 to draw the images.&nbsp; You will need to replace the <code>arc</code> statements
	   in your program with <code>image</code> statements that draw the appropriate 
	   <code>PImage</code> objects when direction is 1 or not.&nbsp; Show your results 
	   to your instructor. (3 pts)
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> <span class="yellow">
       Add code to your program that causes the direction to be changed whenever the user
	   clicks the left mouse button.&nbsp; When the user clicks the right mouse button, nothing
	   should happen.&nbsp; Show your results to your instructor. (3 pts)
	   </span>
	   <br><br> </li>

  <li> Save your sketch, and start a brand-new empty Processing sketch to continue
       with this lab.&nbsp; Go to the "Random" section of Chapter 8 of the textbook, read the text

  <li> Write a Processing program that draws a line from the center of the output window
       to a random location in the window.&nbsp; The output window should be sized to be
	   600 &times; 600 pixels.&nbsp; If the user presses any key on the keyboard,
       the screen should be cleared by calling the <code>background</code> function using
	   204 as the parameter. <br/><br/>
	   
	   Hint:&nbsp; with this size window, the center would be at the point (300, 300), so you should use that as one endpoint of the line you are drawing, and the other endpoint should be random values in the range from 0 to 600 for both the x and y values.&nbsp; How long would it take for your output window to fill
	   up completely with black pixels?
