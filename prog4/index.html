            4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due:&nbsp; 2/23/22
        </h2>

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Write a Processing program that "connects the dots" when the user clicks the mouse
	in various locations on in the output window.&nbsp; If the user presses the space bar,
	the screen should be reset to blank.&nbsp; Each mouse click causes the program to 
	"remember" the location of the mouse when the click occurred.
</blockquote>

<strong>Sample:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Your program should work just like <a href="prog4demo.zip" target="_blank"> 
	this sample</a>.&nbsp; Right-click
	on the link in the preceding sentence and save the file in your CSC108 folder.&nbsp; Then using File Explorer, right-click
	on the .zip file and choose "Extract All" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; After extracting the files from the .zip file,
	there will be a file with a <code>.exe</code> extension &ndash; double-click on the file to run the demo and
	see how your program should work. <br/><br/>
	Run the demo program, move the mouse around the screen, then click either
	mouse button several times while moving the mouse around, then press the spacebar 
	on the keyboard, then click either mouse button again several times.
</blockquote>

<strong>Starting Point:</strong>
<blockquote>
    To get started on this assignment, make a new Processing sketch, then paste the 
	following code into the editor window:

<pre>
/********************************
 * CSC 108
 * Programming Assignment # 4
 * Author: Bill Gates
 * Date:  February 23, 2022
 ********************************/

 
void setup() {
  size(800, 450);
} // end of setup function



void draw() {


  if (keyPressed) {
    if (key == ' ') {

    }
  } // end if (keyPressed)

  
  if (mousePressed) {

  } // end if (mousePressed)

  
} // end of draw function
</pre>

    When you run this program, nothing much will happen &mdash; this is just the starting
	structure for your program.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 1:&nbsp; Declare and Instantiate one <code>int</code> variable and two <code>int</code> Arrays</strong>
<blockquote>
    Above the <code>setup</code> function in your program, declare an <code>int</code> 
	variable named <code>numClicks</code> and set it to zero.&nbsp; Then declare two 
	Arrays that can store
	<code>int</code> values.&nbsp; One of the arrays will keep track of the horizontal positions
	of the mouse clicks, and the other array will keep track of the vertical positions of the
	mouse clicks.&nbsp; It would make sense to call these arrays <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
	but you can use any names you like.&nbsp; These arrays should be set up initially to
	store 500 values each.&nbsp; Refer to Example 11-9 in the
    <a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	textbook</a>
	for an example of how to do this.
</blockquote>

<strong>Your Task, Step 2:&nbsp; Write the <code>draw</code> function for the program</strong>
<blockquote>
    Here is an outline of the logic you should use for the <code>draw</code> function of your program,
	in order to get it to work as the sample does: <br/>
	<ol>
	  <li> Set the background to a medium to dark color that you like </li>
	  <li> if (the spacebar has been pressed):
	      <ol type="a">
		      <li> store the value zero in <code>numClicks</code> </li>
		  </ol> </li>
	  <li> if (the mouse has been clicked):
          <ol type="a">
		      <li> add 1 to <code>numClicks</code> </li>
			  <li> store <code>mouseX</code> in <code>x[numClicks]</code> </li>
			  <li> store <code>mouseY</code> in <code>y[numClicks]</code> </li>
          </ol> </li>	
      <li> set the stroke color to some color you like </li>
      <li> set the fill color to some color you like </li>
	  <li> for each value of <code>i</code> from 1 up to and including <code>numClicks</code>:
	       <ol type="a">
		       <li> draw an ellipse centered at the point (<code>x[i]</code>, <code>y[i]</code>) 
	                that is 30 &times; 30 pixels in size </li>
               <li> draw a line from (<code>x[i]</code>, <code>y[i]</code>) 
	                to (<code>x[i-1]</code>, <code>y[i-1]</code>) </li>
		   </ol> </li>
      <li> set the stroke color to some color you like that is different than the one used above</li>
      <li> set the fill color to some color you like that is different than the one used above</li>
	  <li> draw an ellipse centered at the point (<code>mouseX</code>, <code>mouseY</code>) 
	       that is 30 &times; 30 pixels in size
      <li> draw a line from (<code>mouseX</code>, <code>mouseY</code>) 
	       to (<code>x[numClicks]</code>, <code>y[numClicks]</code>) </li>
	</ol>

<strong>Comment Header at the Top of your Program:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Be sure to change the comment header for your program so that it uses your name and
	has today's date.
</blockquote>

<strong>How to Submit the Program for Grading: </strong>
<blockquote>
    When you have completed your programming assignment, upload the <code>.pde</code> file
	from the directory in which you saved your final version of the programming assignment
	into the <b>Program4</b> dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
