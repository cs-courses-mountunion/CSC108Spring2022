<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Write a Processing program that draws three circles in a
	400 x 400 drawing window that have different letters
	drawn on them.&nbsp; The program should respond to mouse clicks on the circles by displaying
	a word on screen that begins with the same letter as the one in the circle that was clicked
	upon.&nbsp; The program should also respond to key presses on letters displayed in the 
	circles by displaying the same word on screen that begins with the letter typed.
</blockquote>

<strong>Sample:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Your program should work just like <a href="prog2demo.zip" target="_blank"> 
	this sample</a>.&nbsp; Right-click
	on the link in the preceding sentence and save the file in your CSC108 folder.&nbsp; Then using File Explorer, right-click
	on the .zip file and choose "Extract All" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; After extracting the files from the .zip file,
	there will be a file with a <code>.exe</code> extension &ndash; double-click on the file to run the demo and
	see how your program should work. <br/><br/>
	Run this demo program and 
	type the following keys:&nbsp; A, then B, then C, then the space bar.&nbsp; 
	Then click the mouse on each circle and on the gray background of the drawing window.<br/><br/>
	If you're having trouble downloading or running the sample program, you can watch a screen capture <a href="prog2.mp4">here</a>.
</blockquote>

<strong>Starting Point:</strong>
<blockquote>
    To get started on this assignment, make a new Processing sketch, then paste the 
	following code into the editor window.&nbsp; Then change the parameters of the 
	<code>size</code> function so that the display window is correct for this assignment.

<pre>
String firstLetter =  "A";
String secondLetter = "B";
String thirdLetter =  "C";


void setup() {
  size(80, 50);
  smooth();

  drawCircles();
} // end of setup


void draw() {

    // handle the user typing a key on the keyboard
    
    
    
    // handle a click of the mouse by the user
    
    
    
} // end of draw


void drawCircles() {
  stroke(255);
  fill(0);
  textSize(84);

  ellipse(110,  100, 80, 80);
  ellipse(210,  100, 80, 80);
  ellipse(310,  100, 80, 80);

  fill(255);
  text(firstLetter,  82, 130);
  text(secondLetter, 182, 130);
  text(thirdLetter, 282, 130);

  stroke(204); 
} // end of drawCircles
</pre>

<strong>Your Task:</strong>
<blockquote>
    First of all, change the program so that it displays your initials in the circles.&nbsp;
	If you don't have a middle name or if your initials contain duplicate letters, choose other
	letters so that three different letters are displayed in the circles.&nbsp; You must have
	three different letters displayed by your program. <br/><br/>
	
	You must add code to the <code>draw</code> function of this program to respond to 
	user input in the following manner.
	<br/>
	<ul>
	    <li>When the user types a key on the keyboard,
		    <blockquote>
			    Set the background color of the window to 204, and call the
				<code>drawCircles</code> function. &nbsp; Then use an <code>if</code>
				statement to test the key that was typed &mdash; if that is either the 
				upper-case version of the letter in the left circle, or the lower-case
				version of that letter, then change the fill color to some color you like
                and use the <code>text</code> function to display a word that starts with
                the letter in the left circle at screen position (10, 370). <br/><br/>
                Use more <code>if</code> statements to respond to key presses that correspond
				to the letters shown in the other two circles.&nbsp; Use different colors
				and be sure that each word displayed starts with the letters shown in
				the circles. <br/><br/>
				See Example 5-18 in the "Type" section of Chapter 5 in the 
				<a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	            textbook</a> to see how to test for both the upper- and lower-case version
				of a key.
		    </blockquote>
		</li>
	    <li>When the user clicks the mouse,
		    <blockquote>
			    Set the background color of the window to 204, and call the
				<code>drawCircles</code> function. &nbsp; Then use an <code>if</code>
				statement to test the distance of the mouse position from the center of
				the left-most circle &mdash; if that distance is less than half the size
				of the circle, then change the fill color to some color you like
                and use the <code>text</code> function to display the same word that starts with
                the letter in the left circle as was used in the keyboard processing described
				above.&nbsp; Display the word at screen position (10, 370). <br/><br/>
                Use more <code>if</code> statements test to see if the mouse click occurred
				inside the center or the right circle, and display the same word that was used
				in the keyboard processing for that letter.&nbsp; Use the same color
				for each word, no matter if it is displayed because of a mouse event or a 
				keyboard event. <br/><br/>
				See Example 5-14 in the "Location" section of Chapter 5 in the 
				<a href="../resources/oreillyAccessInstr.html" target="_blank">
	            textbook</a> to see how to test for a mouse position being less than a certain
				distance from a point.
		    </blockquote>
		</li>
	</ul>

<strong>Comment Header at the Top of your Program:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Place a comment header at the top of your program similar to this example, with information
	specific to you and your assignment:
	
<pre>
/********************************
 * CSC 108
 * Programming Assignment # 2
 * Author: Bill Gates
 * Date:  January 31, 2025
 ********************************/
</pre>	
</blockquote>

<strong>Extras:</strong>
<blockquote>
    Instead of displaying a word that starts with the letter selected by the user, can you 
	draw a sketch of something that starts with that letter?&nbsp; For example, you might
	draw a picture of an apple, or a bear, or a cat if your initials are ABC.
	<br/><br/>
	Can you use a square or a rectangle or some other shape other than a circle to contain
	your letters?&nbsp; You'll have to change the way you detect a mouse click inside the
	shape, because the technique described above and shown in Example 5-14 only works for a
	circle.&nbsp; Give it a try!
</blockquote>

<strong>How to Submit the Program for Grading: </strong>
<blockquote>
    When you have completed your programming assignment, upload the <code>.pde</code> file
	from the directory in which you saved your final version of the programming assignment
	into the <b>Program2</b> dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
    <br/><br/>
